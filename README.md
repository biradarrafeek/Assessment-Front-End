# TODO LIST

## Overview
The TodoList application is a practical project built using React that helps in managing tasks efficiently. This project serves multiple purposes and provides several key benefits:

### Task Management
The TodoList application offers a straightforward way to manage tasks, allowing users to:
- Add new tasks
- Update existing tasks
- Mark tasks as done
- Search for tasks

### React Fundamentals
This project is an excellent way to learn and practice core React concepts, including:
- State management using hooks (`useState`)
- Component structure and composition
- Event handling and conditional rendering

### Form Handling
The application demonstrates handling form inputs and validation in React, ensuring that users provide necessary information before creating tasks.

### Dynamic and Interactive UI
With features like task creation, updating, and marking as done, the TodoList project shows how to create a dynamic and interactive user interface.

### Error Handling
The project includes error handling, providing user feedback such as displaying an error message when trying to add a task without a title.

### CSS Styling
Styles are separated into a different CSS file, following best practices in organizing styles for a clean and readable codebase.

### State Management
Managing the application's state with hooks helps understand how to handle data flow within a React component.

### Filter and Search Functionality
The search functionality allows filtering tasks, demonstrating data manipulation and rendering in React.

### Timestamp Handling
Tasks have timestamps that update when changes are made, teaching how to work with JavaScript Date objects and manage time-related data.

### Responsive Design
The project follows responsive design principles to ensure the application works well on various screen sizes.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
